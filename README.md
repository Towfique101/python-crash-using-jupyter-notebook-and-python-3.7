This is a small initiative to complete the full book of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. All the credits are to the author who spent a lot of time and effort to help enthusists like me to learn python. I deeply appreciate his dedication towards making this book so simple that with just a little knowledge about programming anyone can understand how to work with Python. My outmost respect and honor towards Eric Matthes for his brilliant book.
